        The day she realizes she is an awful person is the same day her sister’s husband is laid to rest. It’s a gloomy, weepy day, something straight out of a movie. The raining sky has nothing on the torrent of tears streaming down her sister’s face. She holds her sister’s shaking hand, trying to draw her grief away from her. 

“I’m going home to an empty house today. For…for the first time in six years, I’m going home alone,” her sister whispers hoarsely. 

She squeezes her sister’s hand tighter in comfort. Alone. What a strange concept. She hadn’t felt alone in years. Between her own husband and their three children, their house always felt so full. She imagined going home alone; no husband, no children running to her–needing her as soon as she stepped through the door. No dinner that needed to be cooked, no toys that needed to be picked up, no laundry that needed to be done. No needs at all, beyond her own.

As they stand there, watching her brother-in-law’s casket be lowered into the ground, she is overcome with the most sickening, reprehensible feeling. Not grief. Nothing as simple as that. Not even relief that it happened to her sister instead of her–no, even that would have been more digestible. It was the opposite–she was jealous of her widowed sister. Jealous. Of her widowed sister. 

Horrified, she tries to tamp down the nausea that threatens to consume her. She loves her husband and children. She loves her life. Since she was a child, all she had wanted was to marry the man of her dreams and have her own babies and that’s exactly what she had done. She hadn’t felt alone in years. 
…right?

        The calendar hanging in their kitchen has become their saving grace. With her husband’s erratic work hours and three kids that all participated in different afterschool activities, any and all events and appointments had to go on that calendar to be remembered or attended. 

	She stares critically at the sheer number of events that have taken over the upcoming week. One child’s dentist visit, her husband’s DMV appointment, another child’s baseball game, yet another child’s dance recital. The words “PTA meeting” glare at her from the Friday square. 
She sighs. There goes the brunch she had planned with her best friend, who was only in town for a few days.  The workout class she had signed up for was also probably not going to happen. 
As she gazes desolately at the calendar, she feels arms snake around her waist and a kiss planted on her cheek. 
“Hi honey,” her husband greets her. “Don’t forget to write down my work party on Friday evening. It’s going to be a pretty formal event.” 
All of a sudden, she is possessed by an overpowering urge to rip her husband’s arms from her waist. She wants to tear the stupid calendar off the wall and shred it into a thousand pieces. She wants to get in her car and press the gas pedal and not look back for a long, long time. 
But she can’t do any of that. Because little eyes are watching and her husband–who has worked so much overtime recently–needs her to dress up and go to his work party. Because she loves her children and she loves her husband and she loves her life. Because wouldn’t she rather go to a thousand appointments for her kids than sit in an empty house, widowed and childless?
She spends a long moment just breathing in and out. Then she carefully slips out of her husband’s arms, smiling reassuringly at him while grabbing the pen that hangs next to the calendar. 
“Work party on Friday evening. Got it.”

        “This is the Daddy doll, the big brother doll, the little-big brother doll, and the baby doll!” Her daughter exclaims, proudly showing off her cotton-and-fabric family. 
	She sends her daughter a playful glare, her hands on her hips. “And just where is the Mama doll?” 
	“That’s me! I’m the Mama,” Her daughter giggles. She grabs the baby doll and cradles him carefully in her arms. “Look, I hold him just like you holded me!”
	Her heart should melt at this moment. Right? Her daughter is trying to be just like her. But an unexplained ache fills her heart instead. Yes, she is Mama to this little human. But when did she become just Mama and nothing else?  She wants to take the baby doll from her daughter’s arms and replace it with another toy, but she isn’t that cruel. 
She grabs the TV remote instead, intent on distracting herself before she can overthink anything else. An old rerun of Full House fills the screen and she instantly smiles. This show was her childhood. On the screen, little Michelle is in the process of getting married to little Howie. How many times did she watch this episode as a child, sitting in the family room, cradling her own baby doll, like her daughter was currently doing? She remembers wanting to have a wedding just like Michelle, with a long white dress and her own Howie at the end of the aisle.
That little girl’s dreams had come true. She had married her Howie and she had had the babies she always wanted. But now, watching her own little daughter, a sinking feeling takes root in her chest. How much of those dreams were her own true desires, and how much were they the influence of things like TV shows and toys on an impressionable little girl? If her parents hadn’t bought her dolls every Christmas, if she hadn’t watched movies about little girls growing up to become Mamas, if every fairytale handn’t ended in a romantic wedding, would she be where she is now?
Though she hasn’t moved an inch on the couch, her entire world has been thrown into a tailspin. She wants to leave. She needs to breathe. It feels like she can’t breathe in this suburban two-story, four-bedroom house. She can’t breathe, but she can’t leave either. 

She wishes she had never turned on the stupid TV.

	The rain pelts down on them, soaking them in the short distance from the van to their front door. Her sons laugh delightedly, each holding tightly to one of her hands. She tries to keep a stern face, thinking about all of the laundry she’ll have to do now, but she can’t help but give into a grin, their happiness too contagious to resist. 
The three of them stomp into the living room, a mess of chaos and puddles. She sees her husband sitting on the couch, his face a picture of solemnity, and the laughter stops abruptly in her throat. 
“Hey, boys,” he smiles at them. “Go on up to your rooms and get changed for dinner, okay?”
Her heart speeds up. What was wrong? 
She holds her tongue until she hears the boys’ door slam, then immediately, “Is everything ok?”
Her husband sighs. “We need to talk.”
Those words never brought good things. “About what?”
“About you, about us, probably,” he responds. “Are you happy?”
She feels like a deer caught in headlights. In the months since that fateful day in front of the TV, she had tried her best to act normally. Sure, she may have been a bit subdued, but it hadn’t been noticeable, right?
She clears her throat, tries to get rid of the lump that has already settled there. “Why do you ask that?”
He looks reproachfully at her. “We’ve been married for nearly a decade. I know you. And I know something has changed. You seem unhappy.”
She doesn’t reply, but the tears that well up in her eyes are her answer. He looks devastated. 
“What can I do to change it? Have I been a bad husband?”
“No, no!” She cries. “I don’t know why I feel like this.”
Except she does. But how is she supposed to tell her husband that she didn’t realize until she was in her thirties that this quiet suburban life was never what she wanted, but what everyone else had wanted her to want?

         Months pass by and things get worse. She feels more and more unsettled. She feels angry at herself for ever thinking she could be fulfilled by her role as wife and mother and nothing else. She’s angry at the world for manipulating her into thinking a ring on her finger and a baby on her hip were all she needed to be content with her life. 
It all comes to a head when her husband hands her a stack of papers one day, the D-word standing out clearly to her. 
“I haven’t signed these yet. I don’t ever want to sign them. But if you-if you need this, I’ll do it.” His voice trembles, almost inaudible. 
The chaos and emotions that have rushed in her ears for months now come to an abrupt standstill. The angry haze she has been living for months lifts, and she sees clearly for a moment. 
She takes the papers from his hands, opens her nightstand drawer, and shoves them in. She hugs him hard, trying to convey all the emotions she’s not eloquent enough to articulate. 
She’s not naive. This moment is not going to change everything. But maybe it will change enough for now. 
She grabs his hand, squeezes once, twice, a third time. “Come on, let’s go out somewhere for dinner tonight.”
Deep down, she knows that she will never fill out those divorce papers because no matter how smothered she feels at times, she does love her husband and her children and she always will. She just needs the security of the existence of those papers. She’s okay with being a bird in a gilded cage, so long as the door is wide open for her to leave whenever she wants. 
She chuckles humorlessly at the absurdity of it all; at the messiness and complexity of human emotion. Maybe in her next life, she won’t make the mistakes she made in this one, and she will no longer need the possibility of an escape plan buried deep in her nightstand to finally feel free in her own life.
