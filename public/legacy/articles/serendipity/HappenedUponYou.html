“Yeesss!” I can’t help but squeal as I hang up the phone. I turn my attention to Henry, my golden doodle as I grab his paws and do a little dance with him.
<br>
“Guess who’s getting groomed! Guess who I don’t have to take before the biggest meeting,” I sing badly to him. I let go of his paws to put my finger to my ear and stick the landing. “Of my liiiifeeee!”
<br>
It’s 9 o’clock on a Saturday morning taht I was going to spend trying to deep clean my apartment and contemplating my life, and my dog groomer has just decided to call me randomly. She let me know that a spot had just opened up at 10 this morning, and she knew I was trying to get my appointment in two weeks scheduled. My appointment was at 10 o’clock on May 5. The biggest meeting in my career at the legal company I worked at was at 10:30 on May 5. In other words, I was screwed.
<br>
By a stroke of luck, I have been saved, and my dog will be cleaned.

            “Yes, dude, let’s hang out!” I insist over the phone, swiping impatiently through my closet. My friend Gregory on the other side is hesitant but agrees. It’s 9 o’clock on a Saturday morning I was going to spend binge-watching reality shows, and Gregory has called to seemingly brag about his day of romance in the city again. He instead breaks the news that his and Maria’s midday carriage ride has been canceled. My favorite friends from high school are available to hang out during their day to spend in my city. Gregory feels bad about their initial disposition and decides to pay. I’m grateful that he can’t see the little dance I do in my closet on the phone. By a stroke of luck, I’m getting a free meal and all the tea on my (five-times-broken-up-since-high-school) favorite friends.

          “No way…,” I quickly look up after I realize I’ve said that out loud to see other dog parents looking at me. I quickly apologize, shifting awkwardly in my seat. Then, I look back down at my phone to make sure I hadn’t read incorrectly.
          <br>
          It was true. The best dessert food truck ever, Waff About It, had finally come into the city again after at least 4 years of traveling around the country. Not only had it come back to NYC, but it was also at Junction Park for the day. AKA the park that was a five-minute walk from my dog groomer’s place. 
          <br>
          Rachel, Henry’s regular dog groomer, noticed my expression as she brought him out to me.
          <br>
          “Glad you got this done today instead of two weeks from now?” she asks as she begins to ring up my total.
          <br>
          “Of course! That and my favorite food truck is like just around the corner today,” I say, shrugging off the last bit to appear like I enjoy the food truck a normal amount.
          <br>
          “Ooh, shaping up to be a good day, huh?”
          <br>
          I think about how I started the day, and how I’ve been able to get this big task done, shop around at stores a bit, and even find a nice little treat for myself.
          <br>
          “Yeah!” I laugh a bit incredulously. “It’s pretty lucky - I feel like I’m never able to have days like this.”

“No way. Where is that coming from?” I wonder to myself as I walk home. I’ve just turned the corner from the street Gregory and Maria were parked on. Lunch was awesome - I picked the place and got to enjoy tons of Korean BBQ as they bickered over what caused each argument in the relationship. You’d be surprised how many disagreements started at a gas station. It was all very amusing. Anyway. I’m walking home and I hear a Guys on Stairs song and I truly cannot believe it. I walk faster, turning corners away from my apartment to find the source of the music. Finally, I see him - a street performer set up with a guitar and a microphone with a sign reading, “Come sing a song!” I excitedly join the small crowd, cheering him on with much more energy than the rest of the pedestrians are at. I don’t care, though. I simply must acknowledge Guys On Stairs any time it plays. The performer grins at me.
“You wanna come sing it too, buddy?”
The crowd looks at me in a stare that says, You’d better if you want to make such noise about it.
“Yeah, sure. As long as you expose more people to true, good music!”
Slowly, more people excited about the jazzy tune we were playing joined the crowd. I was only an alright singer, but people still dropped cash in the performer’s little tip bucket. He let me keep $10.
“You’ve got great energy, man!” he compliments me as I depart.
“You know I never do things like this,” I say with a smile. “You’re lucky you played the one thing that draws me in.”

                A woman and a man walk down opposite ends of the street, joining at the center, where a brownstone apartment building stands. The man holds the door open for the lady, holding a small food-to-go container and the leash of her golden puppy. She thanks him, first for opening the door, and second for the compliment he gives to her dog. She tells him he’s called Henry and that he just got groomed today. The man asks about his breed, and he says that he may have seen a similar dog at the park earlier. The woman asks which park and gasps at his answer as she realizes he’s the one who was performing across the street. She asks what song he was performing, and he tells her he’ll put her onto the band as they ride the elevator together. Both getting off on floor 3, she thanks him for the new artist and song. She heads to apartment 305. He heads to apartment 306. They will realize they are neighbors. They will talk about hanging out. And they will both enter their homes, smiles creeping on their faces as they recount the memories of how they happened upon this incredible day.
