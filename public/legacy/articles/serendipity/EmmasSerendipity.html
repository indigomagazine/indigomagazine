        <b>Before</b>
        <br>
        Journal Entry One: 
        <br>
	I think I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that my life is, and always will be, an eternal void of nothingness. Alright, I can admit, that’s a <i>little</i> harsh, but it gets my point across. My growth has felt stagnant since I was seventeen, seems probable that I can chalk this up to the loss of a summery youth I once embodied. Disregarding my high school self, the entirety of my college career is comparable to that of a mundane 9-5, including the high corporate suicide rates. Each day is full of the exact same responsibilities as the last, leaving my brain to be tugged upon by the centripetal force of draining water like that of loose hair in my dilapidated apartment shower. The <u>gnawing</u> feeling of needing more, wanting to be anything other than who I am, has clouded my vision to the point of legal blindness. The only place where my solitude isn’t as bothersome as a morning alarm is a nearby creek that quietly streams past my campus. As a child I fell into similar patterns, sneaking off to the nearby water-filled ditch, suitably named Terabitha, in order to relieve myself from the laborious life of a nine-year-old. What can I say, I’m a creature of habit! In the hopes of regaining the motivation to wake up in the mornings, I choose to visit this creek in times of need. Following my shift, which is strikingly similar to the mundane 9-5 I spoke about earlier, I blast Oblivion by Grimes and start on my way. The dreary sky above, filled with clouds whiter than my reddened scleras, feels like a soft blanket caressing me to sleep. The scenic walk I’ve become accustomed to during the bright spring semester has been replaced by dead trees filled with limp, decaying branches and crumbling leaves. The narrow walkway is littered with plastic wrappers which have endured arduous winds to end up tangled in fading vines. In an attempt to distract myself from the polluted wasteland (Ok, yes. I’m being dramatic), I force myself to trudge toward the wooden bridge. The small strings of hope I was holding seemed to slip through my fingers like silk. The thick, humid air around me no longer feels like a hug and more like a tight grasp around my neck. All that’s left of my place of solitude is that old bridge, two orange peels, and some freshly carved initials.

        <b>During</b>
        <br>
        Journal Entry Two:
        <br>
	Did I leave an inanimate object on a cliffhanger, is that even possible? Anyways, following the mentally-destructive discovery I made, I chose to take a break from writing. The combination of a deserted creek bed paired with my severe Seasonal Affective Disorder did not bode well. Unfortunately, life does not stop simply because you feel like you’ve begun to drown in your own sentiment. Sea, Swallow Me by Cocteau Twins was the embodiment of suffocating emotions that welled up inside me. Despite my struggle in reaching the surface, it seems things may be starting to look up. With my brightened perspective, the world around me began to fill with symbols of joy. The pessimism I was plagued with no longer obstructed the rays of sunlight shining through my window each morning. Previously, this refracted light would be nothing more than a disturbance to my sleep schedule. Rainy mornings that would’ve glued me to my bed now seemed to slow in accordance with my departure from home. Even with the ever-dropping temperatures, my favorite flowers appeared in my most desperate times of need. My mind could not comprehend these small moments of comfort; I had become far too comfortable in my misery. It’s beyond difficult to recognize your own faults, to address the parts that must be modified, and without any real recollection, I had placed myself into an inescapable hole of affliction. Resultingly, my surroundings were drained of any life or color they formerly possessed. Looking back my obliviousness seems glaringly obvious, even intentional, but I know this is just a result of hindsight bias. In the midst of my cynicism, this felt like my only option, it seemed clear that I was unworthy of pleasure. If I were to come upon some magical wishing well, I think my coin toss would be used to question “Why was I not worthy? Am I to blame for my sadness?”. However, it’s unlikely I’ll stumble upon a mystical solution to all my unanswered issues, and truthfully, I don’t think a wishing well could give me the explanation I long for anyways. No matter how daunting it may feel, deep down I know I am the only one able to solve my cognitive misfortunes.

       <b>After</b>
       <br>
        Journal Entry Three:
        <br>
	    How many more times will I return to this journal claiming to be a brand new person? My guess is somewhere between ten and fifteen, but this could change according to the circumstances. Having said that, I’m reminded of one of those gut-wrenching, Tumblr-esque poetry slideshows that have cursed my feed. A young girl, likely in her 20s, a time where no place feels like home, and yet you’re constantly pleading to go somewhere that no longer exists, posted a quote that has stuck with me since. She claimed, “I’ve changed once again!”, her next post was a simple slide filled with the word “Again”, in what looked to be a never-ending wall of letters. I’m embarrassed to admit an Instagram story enlightened me to such an extent, but it dawned on me that the older versions of me were just extensions of my current self. In previous entries, my being exudes a sense of apathy. Reflecting on what once was led me to romanticize my seventeenth year of life, instead of recognizing the bliss that is growing older. In keeping theme with my past self, and to give you a better understanding of how an inconsequential body of water altered my life, I need to once again discuss my past. Sensitive, a phrase I abhorred and rejected for much of my childhood. Sensitive, a term relegated to my little sister. Sensitive, the realization that being tender is the bravest thing one can do. Months of contemplation, more like my time stuck in my childhood home over winter break, paired with re-runs of the crappy rom-com Serendipity led me to this epiphany. Sometimes, whether you were prepared for it or not, things change. (Who knew?) At one time, the sight of those discarded orange peels would’ve struck my heart with an anger emanating heat. The thought of two teenagers in love carving their initials into the wood for eternity would’ve made me sick with jealousy. Yet, these are no longer the negative emotions elicited from me. Rather, I see my surroundings as glimmering slices of hope, riddled with opportunities to grow and change. It seems my life is no longer an eternal void of nothingness, so maybe, just maybe, I’m ready to wander back to that forsaken stream.
