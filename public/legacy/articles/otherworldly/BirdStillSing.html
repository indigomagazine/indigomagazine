    The first sense to return is touch. You feel cold, soft soil under your fingers and toes. It’s
    soothing, and you dig your fingers in further to ground yourself (literally, you think with an exhale
    too minute to be considered a chuckle).
    <br><br>
    You force your eyes open and immediately regret it after being assaulted by sharp, bright rays of
    sun. The sun never shines this brightly back home. In fact, it’s hardly ever even visible. How do
    these Earth creatures–Humans, you remind yourself–deal with it?
    <br><br>
    After a few more breaths, you sit up, checking yourself for any injuries. Your eyes shift to your
    vehicle, the sight of her crumpled up form increasing your exasperation. Great. You hadn’t
    meant to make Earth your destination–no one ever does–but it seems like you are stuck here
    for the foreseeable future.

</section>

<!--paragraph 2-->
<section class="full-para">
    <p style="text-align:center;">
    Earth is a wasteland. The creatures–Humans!--are vile creatures. Violence and destruction runs
    through their veins. They were graced with the fortune of inhabiting the most nurturing planet in
    the galaxies and they ruined it. At least, that was what you had always been told. You had
    deliberately, and successfully, avoided Earth on all of your journeys. Until now. Fear climbs its
    way into your chest. You are alone, unarmed, and unprepared in the most dangerous place you
    know, amongst the most dangerous creatures you know.
    <br><br>
        </p>
</section>

<!--paragraph 3-->
<section class="para">
    <p style="text-align:left;">
    You take a cursory glance around, taking mental inventory of your surroundings. You’re under a
    large, fluttering green structure with a long brown base. The sunlight flitters in through the gaps,
    warming your face. You instinctively turn toward it as if drawn in. The air seems lighter here than
    back home. It flows in and out of you much more easily. You marvel at the vibrant colors around
    you. Such a stark contrast to the metallic browns, grays, and blacks that you associate with
    home.
    <br><br>
        The sound of giggles catches your attention. Two small Humans chase each other nearby, their
        play unbothered by the appearance of a strange creature and her vehicle. You become acutely
        aware that you are very much in a public place, surrounded on all sides by Humans. The two
        little ones near you collapse on the ground, still giggling endlessly at their own game. A smile
        comes on your face unwarranted, until a moment later, a larger Human approaches the two little
        ones with a stern look on her face. Your smile drops. She grabs the little ones by their arms and
        pulls them up, speaking foreign words in a harsh tone. You knew it. The pleasantry of the little
        ones was an anomaly of some kind. Most Humans act like the grown one who seemed so angry
        and disturbed.
        <br><br>

<!--paragraph 4-->
<section class="full-para">
    <p style="text-align:center;">
        You scramble back to your vehicle, cowering behind it to stay hidden. A jarring sound behind
        you causes you to jump. Jerking around, you are greeted by a scene completely different from
        the gentle green haven you were just in. Hard concrete paves miles and miles of land and loud
        machines jet by at breakneck speed. Tall buildings stretch toward the sky, cold and industrial in
        appearance. Yes, this is the Earth you have heard about. The green haven behind you must be
        an anomaly just like the two little Humans chasing each other.
        <br><br>
      </p>
</section>   
        
        
<!--paragraph 5-->
<section class="para">
    <p style="text-align:left;">
        You decide the best way to navigate your way on this planet is to blend in as much as possible.
        The Humans don’t look very different from you. They have ten fingers and ten toes, like you.
        They have arms and legs and noses and eyes like you, too. You wonder what makes them so
        destructive as a species when their skin is as soft as yours, their hair as unruly.
        <br><br>

        You venture onto the smaller concrete path that seems to be for the walking Humans to keep
        them away from the vehicles speeding by. You hold your chin up and purposefully swing your
        arms, as if you are an everyday part of this busy city. As much as you try, though, you cannot
        hide the awe in your eyes as you take in a piece of this planet you have heard so many
        stories–no, warnings–about.
    <br><br>

</section>

<!--paragraph 6-->
<section class="full-para">
    <p style="text-align:center;">
        As you keep walking, you are surprised to see the same two little ones and the older Human
        you saw in the green haven, now a bit ahead of you. You automatically take a fearful step back,
        but you are shocked when you observe them. This time, there is no aggressive grabbing of
        arms or harsh voices. This time, there is the older Human cradling one of the little ones in her
        arms while gently grasping the hand of the other one. There are animated voices and gestures.
        There is another older male Human coming out of a nearby building, picking up the walking
        child, and…connecting his lips with the older female Human? You’re not sure what exactly you
        are witnessing, but it fills your chest with an unfamiliar feeling, simultaneously pleasant and
        aching.
        <br><br>
</p>
</section>

<!--paragraph 7-->
<section class="para">
    <p style="text-align:left;">
        The further you walk, the more you see multiple little Humans accompanied by one or two older
        Humans. You soon deduce that these are parents and children. Back home, these little ones
        would have been on their own years ago. You yourself have no memory of ever knowing a
        parent. Of course, that is probably the better practice, you surmise, considering you have only
        seen families together on Earth, and Earth is a model no one wants to follow. But that confusing
        feeling in your chest does not seem to agree.
    <br><br>

        Soon, the sun sets and darkness descends, and the city looks a lot more like home. But instead
        of being comforted by this familiarity, you suddenly find yourself missing the feeling of the sun
        illuminating your skin. If Earth was anything like home, it would be a long time before that
        happened again. But to your surprise, the city doesn’t remain dark for long. The concrete paths,
        towering buildings, and little shops become warmly lit, and although it doesn’t feel the same as
        the sun itself, you find yourself lingering in the block of light streaming out of a shop window.
    <br><br>

    <div class="img">

</section>

<!--paragraph 8-->
<section class="full-para">
    <p style="text-align:center;">
        As you peer into the shop, you find yourself locking eyes with a female Human inside who looks
        to be your age. She smiles and gestures to you and then to the entrance of the shop. You aren’t
        sure what she is trying to communicate, so you remain still. She comes to the entrance and
        says something to you. After more silence from you, she grabs your hand and pulls you in. She
        keeps chattering in the foreign language, unperturbed by your lack of response. The shop is
        warm compared to the brisk air outside, and the most pleasant aroma fills your nostrils. You
        automatically inhale deeply, savoring it. The Human sits you down on a fluffy structure even
        softer than the soil you found yourself waking up on hours ago. The shop is nearly empty, and
        you feel apprehensive about being trapped here with this stranger who finds no problem in
        leading you around. But the air outside is cold and the shop is bright and warm, so you stay.
        The Human bustles around behind a slab of marble, puttering with strange-looking machines.
        Soon, she is back in front of you with a container of hot, steaming liquid of some kind. She
        hands you the container with another beaming smile and another incomprehensible comment.
        You are wary of accepting anything from a stranger. But you are hungry and thirsty and the
        stranger’s smile is bringing back that bittersweet feeling in your chest, so you take a hesitant
        sip.
        <br><br>

<!--paragraph 9-->
<section class="para">
    <p style="text-align:left;">
    The longer you spend here, the more you discover. Earth is not what you were told about. Earth
    is cold and warmth. Earth is darkness and light. Earth is the sun and the moon. Earth is people,
    you learn. And the longer you are here, the more you understand about those people. People
    are families. People are affection, care, love. And yes, people can be destructive. People start
    wars and bulldoze trees and pave concrete over grass. People fight, but the birds still sing and
    flowers still bloom. And then people come together and amass resources for war victims and
    refugees. People plant more trees. People help the people help the people help the people. And
    perhaps that is what makes Earth more home than your own home ever was.
    <br><br>

        Years pass. You learn the languages of Earth. You travel beyond the piece of Earth you
        stumbled on and find more expansive green havens and more busy cities. You promise yourself
        that one day, you will return to your own planet, and all the others you have visited, and tell them
        about Earth. Tell them about its people and how it is the furthest thing from a wasteland. Tell
        them how they got it all wrong. You promise yourself that you will leave as soon as you find a
        reason to. But that reason never comes and one day, you take your last breath of the Earth’s air
        and are returned to the Earth’s soil, exactly where you were first born as Human.
