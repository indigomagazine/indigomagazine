        My marketing manager can go die in a fiery hole of scorpions. She rejected my proposal again! The excuse this time was that it was “too risky” and ‘didn’t have enough research.’ I got the necessities. A visionary would be able to see the projections and why the company should use my idea - but not Annie.

        <br>
        Thinking of all the credit I’ll never get infuriates me. What’s worse—Annie had the gall to ask for more data because my marketing strategy is something we can do “in the future.” Future my ass. I told her to take her pity elsewhere. She’s looking down on me. All my team is! They should be put into their place.

        <br>
Something finally went right today! After our department meeting, I pulled Annie to the side, right near where Mx. Atta always stands to talk to stragglers, and Annie couldn’t say anything as I told her how I felt “neglected by her managing.” I sniped her a few times, a couple things about her not replying to me and shutting down my ideas without any real explanation.

        <br>
        I just pulled the “poor employee looking for feedback” act, and Mx. Atta fell for it hard, glowering at my dear marketing manager the whole time. Annie got red in the face and fumbling trying to explain to me how she was sorry and would try to do better. 

        <br>
        Serves her right.

        October 5, XXXX

        <br>
        Real justice isn’t a one time act but the torment of one moment stretched into many. One little tattling isn’t enough for Annie to know the consequences of her actions. For one, she’s not smart enough for that, so today’s plan had me undermining her whenever she could open her mouth. Questioning her data presentation, her budget reasoning, her segmentation analysis - anything, even if I knew that it was decent. 


        <br>
        By the end, she cut the meeting short because she wanted to look over her numbers again. She gave us all one of those tight-lipped smiles, and I’m laughing as I recall it now. I tried catching her afterwards, and she brushed me off. Politely, of course, because she knows who holds the leash.

        <br>
        My marketing plan might be in storage for now, but the torment can stand in until Annie understands.

        October 9, XXXX

        I went downtown yesterday. Wasn’t doing much—just enjoying a victory stroll and coming up with the next steps in my plan. I had pretty good ideas too… except now I can’t remember it.
      <br>
I only remember stopping in an alley. One of those hole-in-the-wall kinds of stores stood at the back and was called Remedies and Curios. The front glowed neon violet, and I swear that the cat decoration in the window moved. I felt my skin prickle, but the feeling must’ve been from how I kept replaying Annie’s fumbling face in my head. I was in a good mood, and that store probably got zero business. Well, here I was, generous, to give them hope.
      <br>
Inside was as hippie and emo as you could get. There were dried lizards, goops, weird symbols, and the whole place smelled like incense. I should’ve just left, but there were some jars on the shelves that pulled my attention.
      <br>
I’m still not sure what was in them. The contents weren’t solid, not exactly liquid or gas either. It shifted when I tipped the bottle, but even when it was still, the stuff just flowed. Some even lit up without any wires or fire.
      <br>
The labels didn’t help. Each one I read had the suffix -phobia. That’s ridiculous, of course. You can’t bottle a phobia. They must’ve been fancy souvenirs. Smart-aleck knickknacks. 
      <br>
The shopkeeper popped out of nowhere then, out of the shadows. I wasn’t scared. She was just way too quiet, which is bad business practice. No wonder there weren’t any customers.
      <br>
I couldn’t see the shopkeeper’s face, just saw that she wore a lot of black, lace, and bloody red lipstick. We chit-chatted until she asked if one of the jars stood out to me.
      <br>
They didn’t, but my eyes stopped on something, a little vial of amorphous white with red edges. I couldn’t control the sight of my gaze, the reach of my hand, the grip in my fingers. The lady smiled at me, pearly white trapped inside a grin of red. The rest is a blur. I probably just need some sleep.

      October 19, XXXX
      <br>
      I’m getting headaches. No meds are helping. I keep blanking out—I’m doing one thing one moment, then something else the next. The doctor said I’m physically fine, but something’s got to be wrong. 
      <br>
Damn condition’s making me as jumpy as a rodent. Annie’s reducing my workload, seeing me as deadweight. I want to shut her up, but then something taps my shoulder. I get a chill, and my throat gets tight, like if I speak, <em>they</em> will know.
      <br><br>
      October 23, XXXX
      <br>
I’m not making them up. There are THINGS in the shadows! I don’t know what or how, but they’re physical. They pull at my clothes, they trip me, they mess up anything electronic I touch. I can’t type with the entire computer crashing or call when my phone short circuits randomly. Annie even told me to stay at home for a while.
      <br>
Docs insist that I’m fine, everything’s fine, but it’s not! My vision’s flashing white and red, and sometimes I see <em>them</em>—these dark wispy creatures. I’m not making them up. I hear them whispering and see them squirming when it’s too quiet, like they’re staking out their prey.
      <br><br>
      October 26, XXXX
      <br>
Something’s after me. Don’t know what it is, but it’s <b>here</b>. It’s circling my home, following me at the heel. 
      <br>
That store. With the phobia jars and the lady with the black, lace, and red. All the weirdness started happening after I visited it. Did they curse me? I wrote the name, but it’s all crossed out now. How? When? 
      <br>
And there’s an entry on the 13th, but I went to sleep early that night. Couldn’t be, unless…
      <br>
Did… I cross out the name? Did I write that stuff on the 13th? 
      <br>
No. No no no no—
      <br>
      <br><br>

October 31, XXXX
      <br>
The vial—it’s here on my counter— I didn’t take it! How is it here? It’s not white anymore but black and red—
      <br>
They’re here. They’re here They’re here I’m not making them up! Why do they want me? I didn’t do anything! Not me not me not
