       Sanctuary is nothing but a fallacy. A room with a single light that extinguishes without a moment's notice. Nothing really lasts forever, as darkness lurks around the corner. The dark isn’t anything new. It has always been there - watching. The light is venomous as it emerges from the familiar and strikes when one feels the most vulnerable. Fear in the dark means little, but fear of the light is haunting. It’s mundane to feel fear in the darkness - makes you human. But to fear light itself, what else is there to hope for? 
<br><br>
Dancing to the music of the shadows is comforting, knowing that it may never end. The ground beneath me is still with every step that I take. The screams of the past sing along to the music as my heart feels heavy. But dance is all that I can do. All that I can hold on to in such a revolting world. A step forward and a step back cramped within the dark; I move to the sound of the past. With my eyes closed, I take comfort in the darkness of my soul, knowing that nothing may change. With each step I take, I falter as the hands of past skeletons grab onto me. Cold and distant, they pull me down. The stench burns my nose as I glide, carrying the scars left behind.
<br><br>
From the horizon, a ray of light shines through. My heart sinks.
<br><br>
The darkness begins to fade, leaving only a shadow behind. A smile adorns my face as the hands slip away, leaving me to myself. The screams fade, leaving behind the music. But I hate it. I hate how bright the light shines. I hate how for a moment, my heart feels light. I hate the happiness that the light brings. I hate it because I fear it. It's better to hate something you fear so that it may never take control.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, my steps get stronger as I glide along the floor. What was once a cramped room is now a meadow. A path is unveiled with yellow daisies marking its way. The path goes on for miles, as though it's never-ending.
<br><br>
Lies.       
<br><br>
The light will always end. It's a demon in disguise. It promises untruths just until you feel ready to let go of the past when it shatters the world around you. I walk along the path of daisies, like always. It's tempting to believe in hope with what the light shows you. Yet, nothing lasts forever, repeats the voice in my head.    
<br><br>
My feet keep taking me forward, no matter how much my mind wants to stay behind in the darkness. From the distance, an unfamiliar sound echoes. I look up at the sky to see a bluebird. That never happened before.
<br><br>
Forget it. Yet, my feet begin to run after the bird. It takes me to a gate. On the other side, there is no path, but a forest of flowers and birds.        
<br><br> 
Is this it? For the first time, a smile of my own takes over my face. I lean over to touch the gate, feeling the cold metal on my skin.
<br><br>
Something real.
<br><br>
I push at the gate and it opens. Freedom within arm's reach. I take one step when the light begins to fade. The bird disappears and I'm left in the darkness all over again. I reach out toward the light that is left as the cold hands grab onto me again. The last orb of light fades into the darkness, leaving me all alone.
<br><br>
"Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise"
<br><br>
But the sun only lasts for so long until darkness takes over once again.
