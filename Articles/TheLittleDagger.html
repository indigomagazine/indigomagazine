        The little mermaid looked at her hand, as the small silver knife lay before her. Glinted in the first red stripes of dawn. Offered her redemption. How could it be that an item so small could be the harbinger of a decision so big? Though something in her heart told her this would be easy.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’d been only a few hours since her world had come crashing down, since her dreams were 
        <br>
        reduced to ash before her. The little mermaid had so much to say in those moments, if she only 
        <br>
        had her voice. All she’d wanted to do is cry out for him.
        <br>
<em>How could you do this to me?</em> She’d start. 
        <br>
<em>After all I’ve suffered through.
  <br>
Clearly, I’m the one who cares about you.</em>
        <br>
And finally, after he’d been forced to hear her for the first time.
        <br>
<em>I was the one who saved your life.</em>
She closed her eyes and crumpled against the side of the ship remembering her first encounter with the prince, and the beautiful human she saw when he lay there unconscious. She knew it was love at first sight. She thought it’d be the same for him, once she turned human.

        Her head was crowded with screams that could not leave her mouth. She clutched onto the little dagger in her hand, fair skin being soiled with drawn blood. What to do with all this pain? What to do with the man who’s broken her heart?
<br><br>
Deep down in her heart, she still yearned to be with him. She remembered the magic of a night just like this, aboard a ship like this one, eyes glimmering in reflection of the festivities. All she’d wanted was a taste of human life. All she wanted was a taste of true love. The prince was still a gorgeous human being with a gorgeous human soul. That she got the chance to even be near him, that she got the chance to save his life…What a cursed romance, a love that would never have the chance to be. Witches, and potions, and a voice most angelic from above ground to below. Balls, and dances, and legs that betrayed any notion of intended function, with the way they stabbed and ripped with each small movement, that the little mermaid had to endure the pain on the tips of her toes. All of this, and a princess…and a dagger.

        The little mermaid growled, a wretched sound that came from deep inside of her that she could only force out of her tongue-less throat. The chills of sea air made her hair stand on end. She could’ve been as cold as a corpse. Her eyes lifted slowly to the prince’s tent. She gripped onto the dagger tighter as she let go of the side of the ship and began to drag her legs in that direction. She was no longer the elegant dancer the prince loved at the ball. She slammed each step down hard and let the pain serve as a reminder of the foolishness that brought her here. Foolish to let herself dream. Foolish to bet her life on a suicide mission. Foolish to want more.

       The little mermaid pulled back the tent’s curtain and saw the prince, sleeping peacefully with his bride, her head resting gently on his chest. Foolish…to pass up a woman like her. In just a moment, flashes of a life that could’ve been played in the little mermaid’s mind. The joy the prince could’ve had when he’d first hear her sing. The grand ceremony they would’ve had to celebrate their love. The collective soul they would’ve shared on their last day on Earth. That was what the little mermaid was really after, she realized. To have a soul, one that was hers, that would live on in all eternity. Who was this heartless man who would rob her of a soul?

        Dead, and by her hands. The little mermaid lunged forward with a screech that woke the poor lovers. The prince was slower to react. He held his hands up as the little mermaid extended her arm as far as she could forward. The little mermaid felt the dagger pierce skin and the prince screamed, pleading with her. She looked into the prince’s sweet brown eyes - eyes that had only seen luxury, so innocent to the world. The little mermaid appeared to soften, then swung a leg up and planted a foot dead onto his chest, pinning him down. The prince tried to hold the knife as it resisted the flesh around his heart, but the little mermaid was stronger. She savored each inch of the knife as she felt it plunge further into the prince’s heart. Blood spilled onto his shirt, and the little mermaid reveled in the wet feeling at her toes. The pain was already starting to melt away.

       The little mermaid pulled her dagger out of the prince’s chest, wiping it on his nightshirt. The princess was still screaming bloody murder at her once groom-to-be. The little mermaid grunted at her, before hobbling out of the tent. She could feel her transformation beginning to take form. Though she felt herself returning to her initial form, she could feel in her heart that things had changed. Though she still be a little mermaid, she had now seen and experienced so much more. The little mermaid and her little dagger.
