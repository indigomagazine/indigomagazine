        S-so I’m just supposed to start…talking?
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        Okay, um. I can do that.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        I guess it started like, maybe a month ago? I started noticing something…wrong, I - I couldn’t describe it to you. Whenever I’d walk past that fountain at the Plinth, it’s like for a second something would happen, something, I don’t know, unnatural.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        I didn’t say anything, obviously. I thought it was just like, exam stress. And to be honest, I have few enough friends already, I don’t need them thinking I’m crazy.

        …well, I guess me being crazy would be the easy explanation.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
I’m not. I’m not crazy, I swear, I-
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        …
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        Sorry, right.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        Next probably would’ve been…the visions. They started as just, little flits of movement, always dancing at the edge of my vision. Always coming from the surface of the fountain. I told myself that it was just a trick of the light. Like, shadows. So I ignored it.

        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        But it just kept getting worse, and worse.

  <section class = "paragraph">
    <p>
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
        One day, I thought I saw one of the shadows leap at me. It…it startled me so much, I fell over and had to pretend I tripped over something. And that wasn’t even the worse part. After I fell, I thought I could hear…laughing, from the fountain.

        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        Not from the other side of it. Not from someone next to it.

        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        I could hear someone laughing inside the water.

        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        I started walking around the Plinth to get to classes. I think my friends started to notice. They started asking me why I was so jumpy all the time. Why I looked so pale. 

        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        What was I supposed to say? That the fucking shadow people were after me? Yeah, right…
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
I did a good job of avoiding the visions, at least for a few weeks. Then, one night, I was heading back from class. It was late, and I thought, ‘I’ll just cut through real quick. It’ll be fine.’

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
I should’ve noticed.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
Noticed when there wasn’t anybody around, even though it wasn’t that late.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
Noticed when there was a light fog rolling on the ground, because when was the last time we had fog?

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
Noticed when I was running for far too long because the Plinth was not this far across and I definitely should’ve been somewhere, anywhere else.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
I heard the fountain flowing. Water, splashing and bubbling. I thought…I thought I could get my bearings if I got closer. Guess I can’t make fun of those idiots in horror movies anymore.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
It was loud, way louder than it should’ve been. I could’ve screamed and I probably wouldn’t have been able to hear myself. I should’ve turned around and tried to leave again. The fountain was in the middle of the Plinth, so I would’ve gotten somewhere if I had just gone the opposite way.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
But I didn’t. Instead, I just…just couldn’t help it. I wanted to know, needed to know.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      So I looked in the fountain, and instantly regretted it.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      They looked awful. Skin melting off the bone, muscles twisted into horrible knots and lumps, limbs sticking out at every angle. They lurched from side to side, like some sort of grotesque dance, and there were just so many of them. And their eyes, their eyes looked so…so empty. Like they were gaping open to try to swallow something.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      One of them was looking up at me. Looking up with its horrible empty eyes, and its crooked smile filled with…God, there were so many teeth. Just…too many, and they were all weird shapes and sizes. It raised what I think was a hand at me, I couldn’t tell because all its…fingers? Yeah. Its fingers were all long and crooked, and they were all twitching in weird directions.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      Every horrible feeling I’d had in the past month suddenly came crashing into my head, telling me to run. So I did. I ran until my legs gave out. Still got the scrapes, see?

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      …I felt it though.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      Droplets of water hitting the back of my neck as I ran. Like something had come bursting out of the water.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
Haven’t gone back there since. Thank god I only have a semester left, because I don’t even know if I can keep coming back to campus.

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      …
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
How do you…yeah. Yeah, I do have nightmares. Sometimes…sometimes I see a hand, clutching the edge of the fountain. A hand with gray skin, and - and too many fingers. But that’s normal, right? Like, I don’t know, PTSD or something, right?

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
…

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
What…what do you mean it gets ‘worse’?

      <br><span class="tab"></span>
How could it possibly get worse…
