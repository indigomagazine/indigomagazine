    <h1>The Harmful Trope of Transness in Horror Films</h1>

        Alfred Hitchcock’s <em>Psycho</em> (1960) may have been revolutionary in the world of cinema, but in some ways, it was far more regressive. It gave birth to a trope that relies on the exploitation of someone who subverts the standards associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. <em>Psycho</em> follows the events surrounding Norman Bates, a troubled yet reserved hotel manager who keeps busy with taxidermy and dressing in women’s clothing. His effeminate nature is a result of murdering his mother and adopting her as part of his own personality. Bates and many characters that were modeled after him cultivated a trope that relentlessly villanized features of trans individuals in a time when queer representation was scarce.

        A little over a year before <em>Psycho</em> was made an emblem of classic horror films, it was a book written by the novelist Robert Bloch. Bloch was known to have been inspired by the serial killer Ed Gein who was active in the 1950s. Gein’s modus oporerandi bore a striking resemblance to that of Norman Bates in the way that they both suffered a perverse attachment to their late, oppressive mothers. There is little evidence that supports the notion that Gein actually wanted to be a woman. The nature of his crimes has been described moreso as a product of misogyny and a “heterosexual obsession with the female form,” but the sensationalized news of the time often pushed a narrative that further damaged the image of trans people in an already conservative climate (Ophelders, 2019).

        The depiction of crossdressing as a perversion and something which contributes to the depravity of an antagonist has been perpetuated in horror films ever since Hitchcock brought it into the mainstream. It has remained constant, appearing in classics such as <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, <em>Sleepaway Camp</em>, and <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> but also more recently, <em>Terrifier</em>. It’s doubtful that any of these characters were created out of a malicious and conscious desire to further harm the trans community. Silence of the Lambs even partakes in a bit of haphazard damage control as the protagonist, Clarice (Jodie Foster), states “there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.” Additionally, both the actor who portrayed the nefarious Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) and director Jonathan Demme insist that the character is in no way transgender. However, this sentiment falls flat when the scene which explicitly states this in a conversation between a doctor and a detective was removed from the film.

        The underlying message of these films is part of a much bigger problem. In the instances of earlier films, they served to be some of the only mainstream representations of what the public understood to be transgender people. Not only do they grossly misrepresent them, but they also reinforce the idea still pushed by many politicians today that trans people are dangerous, whether it’s minors receiving treatment or using the bathroom which matches one’s identity. Repeatedly portraying people with trans characteristics as aggressors in media, in addition to being damaging, also couldn’t be further from the truth. Trans people are over four times more likely to fall victim to a violent crime than their cisgender counterparts. It is bitterly ironic that the same genre that has historically broken the mold and battled censorship perpetuates something so ignorant.

        Regardless of some of its disreputable roots, transgender representation in both film and TV has improved remarkably. An increasing amount fleshed out transgender characters are being written with legitimate motivations and flaws—flaws that rightfully have nothing to do with their gender identity. Echos of horror’s transphobic past are still found lingering in certain films today but are justly overshadowed. Films like <em>Boys Don’t Cry</em>, <em>A Fantastic Woman</em>, and <em>Tangerine</em> are paving a new way with diverse and honest stories. What began with exploitative and harmful characters isn’t doomed to end that way.
