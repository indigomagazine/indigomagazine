        &emsp;&emsp;In a faraway place filled with blue men, rhinestones, 
        and time-traveling fairies, the surreal French musical 
        called Donkey Skin takes place. Directed by a notable 
        figure of the French New Wave movement, Jacques Demy, 
        it’s a  retelling of an eccentric fairytale written 
        over three centuries ago. Demy preserves the magic of 
        the original while staying true his own campy style.
        <br>

        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;As the film begins, the queen of the kingdom (Catherine 
        Deneuve)  falls ill and dies. The heartbroken king (Jean
         Marair) professes he could never love again, but the 
         queen has a bizarre request—she asks that he gets 
         remarried only after finding someone more beautiful 
         than herself, so he can create an heir to the throne. 
         His men look for a queen, but none are to his liking 
         until he is shown a picture of his own daughter
          (Catherine Deneuve). He’s ultimately talked into 
          asking his daughter to be his wife by his advisors, 
          and naturally, she’s appalled. She seeks advice from
           her fairy godmother (Delphine Seyric) whose glamor
            reflects that of a 1920s flapper girl. She gives the
             princess sound advice in the form of a song where 
             she breaks down why children shouldn’t marry their 
             parents. She references items from the future and 
             constantly alludes that there was a failed romance 
             between her and the king, leaving her scorned.


    <br>
    
    <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; The princess attempts to stop the incestuous 
    marriage by giving him unreasonable requests she expects to 
    be impossible, but when her father successfully gifts her 
    dresses that capture the beauty of the sun and the sky, 
    she’s forced to take extreme measures. She insists on one 
    last gift—a skin made from the kingdom’s prized donkey which 
    poops treasure. As the film went on I began to realize why 
    there was never a children’s adaptation. Naturally, the king 
    is apprehensive to slaughter the source of his riches, but 
    he obliges, gifting her a donkey skin that she uses as a 
    disguise to run away.
 
        <br>

        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;
Using the gifts of her oppressive father, she makes a new life 
for herself. She lives in a cottage in a faraway kingdom and is 
subject to ridicule from cruel townspeople. When a prince 
(Jacques Perrin) finds his way to her on a walk through the 
woods where the pair falls instantly in love. He becomes sick 
upon arriving home and his only desire is a cake baked by the 
mysterious girl known as Donkey Skin. Begrudgingly, his parents 
send guards to make his cake dreams come true. The princess 
bakes it, slipping her ring into the batter. Naturally, once 
finding the ring the prince invites every girl in the kingdom 
to try it on until finding the maiden it fits.

The unusual tale combined with Demy’s unique storytelling makes 
donkey skin instantly iconic. At face value, the original story 
isn’t exactly special. It echoes the same rags-to-riches 
sentiments of Cinderella with added creepy incestuous stakes. 
However, the absurdity of the fairytale works together with 
Demy’s high-art style and references to modern society to 
produce a kind of dramatic irony—the fairy godmother and the 
audience are the only ones who truly seem to grasp how bizarre 
the princess’s conflict is. She likely shares the morals and 
sense of the general audience because she’s from the future. 
This is seen in her allusions to modern technology, liberated 
outlook, and above all else when she makes an entrance to her 
own wedding on a helicopter.

<br>

<br>
&emsp;&emsp;
Much like his previous films, the atmosphere of the movie is 
highly stylized, but Demy’s signature bright colors and charming 
musical numbers seem to serve Donkey Skin in a different way. 
The selectively historically accurate costumes and dreamy sets 
make for a film that transcends space and time. It challenges 
the already subversive French New Wave movement as it turns its 
back on realism entirely to pursue something that is ridiculous 
in the best way.
