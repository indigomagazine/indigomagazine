  <section class = "paragraph">
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>It is said that during the month of October one can hear phantom echoes of a weeping chorus in the halls of university campuses that sends shivers down students' spines. If you pause your studies for just a moment, you will hear it, too.</em></p>
  </section>
  <section class="para">
      <p>
        “I have to go summon a demon,” Darcy said, “so you can go on ahead. I’ll catch up.”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        Nicole snorted and rolled their eyes, sliding their lunch bag to their wrist as they opened their burgundy umbrella. “Yeah, right. Catch you in a bit.”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        The purple circle of Nicole’s umbrella disappeared into the colorful mass of umbrellas as the crowd of university students spilled out from their morning classes. Darcy turned from the door and started down the hall. The dense fog from that morning had disappeared, replaced by rain. She peered out the large gothic windows as she walked the halls, watching the steady droplets turn into an oppressive sheet of gray.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        It wasn’t long before Darcy stood at the door of a stairwell tucked far away from the hustle and bustle of the main campus. She tested the handle. It was unlocked.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        Letting out a shaky breath, she opened the door to pitch black. She fumbled for her phone and turned the flashlight on. The light shone on wooden stairs that Darcy could bet were never made to hold even a feather, let alone a human being. The legend said that the seeker of the demon would find them at the thirteenth step, so that’s what she did.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        She counted in her head—one, two, three, four—until she reached step thirteen, at which point her eyes darted to her surroundings waiting for a scary demon to pop out of nowhere.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        Honestly, Darcy couldn’t believe she was doing this all for good grades on her midterms, but she was desperate at this point; she’d almost give her left kidney to make As. For her sake, she was glad she didn’t have to part with any of her organs (she would much rather keep them if she could, thank you very much), but she valued her GPA more than anything, especially while attending a prestigious university.

A popping noise below her sent a shiver up her spine. She shut her eyes, waiting for the inevitable—it was too late to turn back now.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        She heard someone clear their throat and she squeezed her eyes tighter. Footsteps were coming near her. She almost stopped breathing.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “Are you going to open your eyes?” A deep, buttery voice said. “I promise I am not ugly in the slightest.”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        The unkown person tilted her chin up. Cautiously, she opened her eyes. They dropped their hand from her chin and stepped back.

        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “In fact,” they said, tilting their head to the side, “I’m probably the prettiest thing you’ll have ever seen.”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        Darcy could admit they were quite beautiful. Long, black lashes lined their small eyes, their thick eyebrows to die for, and their lips had a rosy tint that Darcy could tell was natural. Their outfit, however, was a collage of different aesthetics and styles haphazardly thrown together. The floral scarf tied on their head, the green polyester shirt, and the flowy floor-length skirt made them look like someone’s grandma.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        She frowned. “I never thought a demon could look so… tacky.”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        Their bushy eyebrows shot to the sky. “One, I am not a demon, I am a ghost,” they said, defiantly wagging their finger.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “…Isn’t that the same thing?”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “No, not in the slightest! And two–” they stood at their fullest height, shoulders rolled back, head raised high “–do you think a demon could be so handsome?”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “Yes,” they said, as they fake-sobbed into their hands. “Actually that would be the most logical answer.”
      </p>

They let out another dramatically loud sob, then looked at her with a contemptuous glare, though Darcy could see their lip quivering. 
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
“I am the ghost of midterms past. It is an insult to my ancestors to be called a demon.” They whipped their head to the side, placing their hand on their chest. “For you to say that in such a sacred place as this…”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
For the first time, Darcy took in the changed environment, her frown deepening. 
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
“This is a bathroom.” An old one at that. Grime was caked into the grout of the black and white tile flooring. Cobwebs fluttered in the corners of the room and a thick layer of dust graced the toilet seats.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
“Exactly,” they said, smoothing out the ruffles on their sleeves. “They do not call a toilet a throne for nothing.”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
	“That’s not—” she shook her head. “Never mind.”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
	They raised an innocent eyebrow. “Anyways, as I said, I am the ghost of midterms past, but you can call me Omen. Now, do you have your offerings?”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “Offerings make you sound like a demon, you know,” she said, fishing in her bag for the scantrons and fresh pencil. She handed the pack to them.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “And?” They motioned with their hand for more.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “What?”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “My drink!” They huffed impatiently.
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “Oh, yeah.” She reached back into her bag and brought out a bottle of caramel iced coffee. “Here.”
        <br><span class="tab"></span>
        “So,” they started, snapping their fingers, a chalkboard with writing appearing next to them, “what service do you need? We have expanded our options recently. I can do ‘deadline extension,’ ‘your teacher made a mistake so the deadline has been extended,’ ‘you caught your professor having an affair, so now they owe you’, though that one can get a bit messy—”

    <p>
      “Okay, I get it,” Darcy interrupted, shaking her head to rid herself of the memory of the last one. “I need to get all As on my midterms.”
“For that, there is one condition.” They flipped the chalkboard to the other side. “You have to study. It has to be wholly of your volition. If it is not genuine, your wish will not be granted. Understood?”
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
She nodded.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      The chalkboard disappeared in a comical poof as Omen slipped the scantrons into a folder they hadn’t had before, then placed the iced coffee in a mini fridge that appeared.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      Omen slammed the fridge door before it vanished. “I will get your request to headquarters as soon as possible. It was nice doing business with you. Have a wonderful exam season!”
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      Darcy blinked and they were gone. In fact, she was no longer in the dusty bathroom but was back on the stairs. She glanced at the time on her phone. Only a minute had passed since she had watched her friend head out into the rain.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
	Crossing her fingers and hoping this worked, Darcy hurried to her next class.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section class = "paragraph">
    <p>
      
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
Darcy took a shaky breath, her eyes closed, as she sat in front of her laptop. Rain pounded against her dorm window and thunder clapped overhead adding to her already anxious disposition. She had studied relentlessly. She only hoped it was sincere enough to count.
She opened her eyes. All As.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
Relief washed over her followed by gratitude. Even though it had been a service she paid for, she wanted to thank Omen, so she grabbed a jacket and rushed out in the rain.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      By the time she reached the door to the old stairway, she was dripping wet and panting. Leaving pools of water in her trail , she walked to the thirteenth step and waited for the popping sound.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      Things went blurry before shifting back into focus. Omen sat at a wooden desk with teetering stacks of paper on each side, a pair of horn-rimmed glasses they hadn’t worn before perched on the tip of his nose. She was certain they were fake.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      “It really worked,” she said, not waiting for him to acknowledge his presence.
      “What did?” He didn’t bother looking up from his work.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
“I got all As on my midterms,” Darcy said. “Your service works.”
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
He peered over his glasses, a quizzical look on his face. Dark circles under his eyes weighed down his usual chipper attitude and a five o’clock shadow graced his chin. “Headquarters has been down since it flooded earlier this week. No midterm service requests have been fulfilled.”
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      “Well, surely mine was since I got the grades I wanted.”
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      With a sigh, Omen took off his glasses and looked Darcy straight in the eye. A small twinkle glinted in his eye. “Or maybe you are a clever person.”
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      With that, he put the glasses back on upside down and shooed Darcy away with his hand. “Go, I have important matters to attend to.”
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
      Darcy smiled to herself before being taken back to the old staircase.
