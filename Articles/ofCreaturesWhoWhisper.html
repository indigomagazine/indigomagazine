        There is a little creature that has followed me around for as long as I can remember. From my earliest memories, this little creature has never left my side. You can’t see him in photo albums or home videos, but he is as present as the rest of my family. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The creature has black fur, sharp claws, and sharper teeth. He snarls and whimpers and yelps. He whispers words to me–terrifying, heart-stopping words. He is rarely, rarely quiet. But he is comforting in his steadfastness. He is my constant.

     When I was younger, the creature would warn me about storms. Once, I lay in bed in our tiny two-bedroom apartment, listening to the whistling wind and the harsh patter of raindrops hitting our window. My dad, anticipating my fearful reaction, opened the blinds to show me that it was indeed just the wind making the rain tap against the glass window. I acquiesced because, at seven years old, I thought my dad knew everything. But later, when everyone was asleep, the little creature crawled up from under my bed, where he stayed at night, and settled next to me. He whispered in my ears: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>“There is a storm outside, Saee. Do you hear that tapping sound? It’s tree branches, bending from the force of the wind, slamming against the window. If the wind can bend great big trees, then it can take the roof off of our little house, don’t you think, Saee?”</em>  
      <p>

        I gulped. What if the little creature was right? He certainly seemed to know more than me. The apartment was silent aside from the tapping window, my baby brother’s soft breathing coming from his crib, and now, my heart pounding in my ears. Who did I believe? My dad, with his comforting smile and warm hugs, or the little creature, with its sharp claws and grating whisper? 
        <br>
        <br>
I spent the rest of the night praying that the roof of our apartment would stay in place and the windows would hold. Come morning, when the sun shined again, I was convinced that the only thing that kept my family in one piece through the night was the creature’s warning and my sheer will. 
  <br>
        <br>
As I grew up, the little creature grew with me. When I was allowed to stay home alone for the first time at nine years old, and my parents were a little delayed on their way home, the little creature reminded me of the thousand dangers that come with driving a car. When my family went on a cruise in fifth grade, the little creature came with us and spent three days whispering in my ear about boats that sink and waves that overpower. 
        <br>
        <br>
At first, I tried to tell others about the little creature. I wanted to share his wisdom, his warnings, so that they could be as prepared as I was. But it quickly became apparent that the creature was invisible to everyone but me. After the first couple of pitiful glances and dismissive eye-rolls, I kept quiet and decided that if I was the only one who could see the creature, then it was my job to use his warnings to protect me and those around me, just as I did the night of that storm.

        <br> 
The little creature still follows me everywhere I go. Some days he is quiet and almost forgettable. On those days, I lose myself in laughter with friends, but soon enough, his quietness becomes discomfiting. It prickles my skin, like when you know you are forgetting something important, but you can’t remember what. On those days, I feel vulnerable, unprotected, so I will the creature back. He shows up every time without fail, the most loyal companion.
        <br>
        <br>
Sometimes I feel annoyed that the little creature won’t leave me alone. Sometimes I want to lock the little creature outside and never let him in again. Sometimes I think life would be easier without his constant presence. But then he whispers in my ear:
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>
“What would you do without me, Saee? I keep you and those around you safe, don’t I? You need me.” 
        </em>
        <br>
        <br>
And I realize he is right. I have come to rely on his warnings. So as much as his whispers make my hands tremble, my breath hitch, and my heart pound, he always settles in for the night under my bed, with one last reminder of doors left unlocked and intruders breaking in. 
        <br>
        <br>
Other children may have outgrown the monster under their bed, but it seems that mine is here to stay.
