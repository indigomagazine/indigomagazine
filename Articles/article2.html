        “It hasn’t changed.” She said.
        “What do you mean?” 
        “This room. It’s the same still. Worse even—what’s up with all these receipts just piled up here.”
        “Oh, uh, yeah sorry.” The pile of receipts she was referring to were sitting next to my laptop. They were from all over and traveled from my purse to being dumped out in a fit of rage as I struggle to find my lip gloss lost in my bottomless red bag. The same purse I’ve had since I started college, and it hangs over a hook by my door.
        The same purse she has. She sits up straight on my bed, legs swinging back and forth, the exact red purse
        perched nicely right next to her. I look at her face. She’s looking thoughtfully around my room.
        “You also have dishes here. Clothes at that floor—"
        “I—listen, I just ate. I’m normally clean whenever I have time.”
        She laughs. “Jeez, bro, it’s fine. I’m messy, too, you know. I’m just commenting on how it never changed.”
        Her gaze is intense. Her aura is intense. I think I understand why people tend to be silent around me now. I’m
        worried to say the wrong thing lest she looks at me with a critical eye.
        “Right.” I say. “Yeah.”
        “I have a lot of questions.” She says, her fingers coming together. “What have you been up to lately?”
        “Oh, uh, well. I’m just…living, I guess. I go out from time to time. I study. I work as a barista now, so that’s
        cool. I got a tattoo!”
        “Oh!” She sits up straighter, eyes bright, “let me see!”
        I turn my right forearm towards her. The lotus flower is underneath my elbow.
        “Pretty!” She comments. “So mom’s okay with tattoos now?”

        “Weirdly enough.”
        “What have you done in the three years here in college? Is it fun?”
        “Yeah.” I smile at her. “It is. It’s…college. It is what it is.”
        “You have the freedom to do whatever you want.” She said, smiling, “have we gone on adventures? Have we
        published a book?”
        “Uh, well, no—but!” I intercept as her face falls a bit, “but its still in the plan. I just got busy.”
        “What were you doing?” She asked.
        What was I doing? “Surviving, I guess.”
        “Surviving what?”
        “People. People with their own trauma. I don’t know. Lots of things.”
        “I—” She sighs, “you’re scaring me.”
        “Don’t be.” I say, but do I mean it? Don’t be scared, I want to tell her, because you’ll be fine. Yet, as I look
        at a child, I see that she sees me as an adult. I don’t know how to tell her I’m anything but. How do I explain
        to a young girl expecting to be a woman that she is, instead, still a young girl regardless of the years that
        have passed?
        How do I tell her that she’s going to grow in ways she never expected?
        “Change,” I tell her, “is unavoidable.”
        “Are we constantly dealing with new people?”
        “No. We’re just constantly going to become a new person.”
        “Jeez.” She frowns. She’s confused. “I’m scared.”
        “Don’t be.” I look down at the floor. The pile of clothes next to my feet.
        “Do you wish it never happened?” She asked me.
        “What?”

        “What happened. The people that happened. Should I avoid them? Or have I become better because of them?”
            I laugh. “You are so inquisitive. Annoyingly inquisitive.” 
            “Does that part of me change or something?”
            “No.” I tell her with a smile. “No. You learn that sometimes you don’t need to know everything, because you will learn it eventually.” 
            “Do we fall in love?”
            “Yes. And it’s traumatic.”
            “God. Uh, do we find good friends?”
            “Many. All over the world. We become wiser, but it gets lonely to be a nomad, but now you can travel to a lot of places and not have to pay for housing. That’s a plus.” 
            “Are we a better writer?”
            “Yeah. We meet other creatives, too.”
            “Do I…like myself?” 
            I stay silent. 
            Her eyes fall.
            “That’s still a work in progress.” I confess. “We’re still young.”
            “Are you?”
            “I am.” I say. “I have so, so much more to experience.”
            “We’re still young,” she smiles, then her eyebrows furrow. “You’ve changed so much.”
            “Yeah. Are you… upset by it?”
            “No. I don’t think so. No.”
