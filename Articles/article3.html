        The color was exceptionally dawdy. The green, so light it could be yellowand maybe in certain settings it is yellow--would clash against the red undertones of her skin. Her skin  a warm kind of brown, the type of brown the sun likes to rest on, the type of brown colors similar to Earth. Normally, green would set amongst her like clouds against the sky. They would blend around her figure--a symphony of brown melting into green and green melting into everything else--and she’d stand out.
	Not this green.
	The color was pretty, but not on her. It made her skin look dirty. It made the lines around her mouth more prominent. It took away all the attention of brown and beauty and showed light green and the person was unable to properly wear it. Dawdy color. It made her look bad.
	She wiped it off with a napkin. Her friend, perched up on the bathroom counter, back against the mirror, sighed minutely in response. 
	“What?” She asked.
	The friend responded. “It looked good.”
	“No.” It was dawdy. So horrendous on her that she suddenly remembered the word ‘dawdy’ existed. She looked at herself in the mirror, hands coming up to stroke long curly hair. “I shouldn’t have dyed it. Everything looks off today.” 
	“You look good.” The friend said.
	“Right.” She brushed fingers through her hair. It lay limp against her shoulder. “How are you? How’s life?”
	The friend shrugged as they fiddled with a golden bracelet on their wrist. “You know, nothing out of the ordinary. How are you?”
	“It is what it is.”
	“Yeah? What’s going on?”
	She sighed. “My father. He called me up yesterday, you know? God.”
	The friend stayed silent, watching her.

        She continued. “He does this thing, yeah? Like--for example, if he comes home one day. All of a sudden--he gets into a mood. I don’t know what’s going on but I can, like, feel it. It permeates the fucking air. Then he’s acting like a…a…” she sighs, tossing the lipstick tube aside. It made a series of tinkering noises as it bounced around on the bathroom countertops. “I’m so glad I left home. I can’t imagine having to deal with that any longer. 
	And it’s not just that. I don’t--I don’t know how to explain it properly. The way he acts towards me. I think he expected me to be a certain way. I guess he envisioned something from me. He hoped for something before I came along--but then I wasn’t. I guess…early on… I was like…I made him believe I could be this certain type of person. But I'm not. I’m--I’m not.”
	It was silent for a moment. She tapped her fingers on the kitchen counter, her throat constricting in a familiar way. Her friend of several years was right beside her, with their same golden bracelet making softs clinks as they would rest their forearms on the polished granite. 
	“Also, I hate the way he kisses.” She says finally, the last exhale after a long winded rant.
	She and her friend stare at each other.
	They bark out a laugh.
	“Lord.” The friend says, “I don’t know why you deal with this. I never liked him.”
	“He’s my boyfriend. I loved him.”
	The friend shrugs. “Life, I guess.”
	“Yeah. Life. Right. He is such…” she sighs “...an idiot. Can I call my own boyfriend an idiot? That sounds wrong.”
	“He sounds like one.”
	“He does.” She emphasizes. “He does, doesn’t he? I swear. He just wants to change how I act. I need to be a certain way. Do certain things. I guess.”
	“He’s crazy.” The friend chuckles. “Honey, there’s nothing wrong with you. Everyone loves you. Except being with him.

        That’s your biggest flaw.”
	She reaches up to scratch the base of her neck. Short hair brushes against her fingers. For a brief moment, she thought of two years ago, when her hair was long and lovely. She dyed it a nice ombre. Her heart aches when she looks at old pictures. Wasn’t she so happy back then? She was single back then.  “I love him. I do. I love him.”
	“I know.” Her friend pets her hair. “Life.”
	“Life. He does this thing. It kills me inside every time. Every time I disappoint him, he gives me this look. Like I didn’t meet up to his expectations. Not even. Like I deserved all the yelling, the insults, the--the gaslighting, essentially. The look of ‘you could’ve avoided this if you weren’t who you are’. 
	He treats me like…like there’s something wrong with who I am. That I’m too emotional or too reactive or too--too something. Too everything! I’m too much of everything. Too much of the wrong stuff. Never enough of the right stuff. I don’t know what’s wrong or right. I don’t know how to be. How do I be?”
	The friend blinks under the sunlight, looking over at her. They raise their hand to shade their eyes against the rays, golden bracelet shining.  “Why do you stay?”
	“What?”
	“Like…why do you deal with it? Beat him up.” The both of them laugh together. “But seriously--leave. You’re too good for this. You are. You’re not a bad person. What you are is annoyingly naive.”
	“It’s not that simple.” She answered softly. She sat beside her friend on the balcony. Her long black hair in a braid thrown over her shoulder. 
	She then paused. The sun was nice, the air was crisp, and her friend of half a decade, stretched out tight limbs. She picked at her nails. It was the best kind of weather to pack up an apartment. It was the best kind of weather to say goodbye to an era. It felt different.

	Yet, unfortunately, everything felt the same in the worst way possible.
	“She’s like…my friend.” She responded to her friend, but the words felt like sludge in her mouth. They felt like food that’s been swirling in her stomach for years only to be spit out in moments like these--moments of humility where once again, she is vulnerable and sick. The feeling was so raw and pitiful, and she wondered why she felt so dejected over something that was supposed to be so simple.
	Why does it hurt so much? One friend gone always meant two others came in its stead. One friend was gone, but she had a life of wonderful memories with friends who’ve stayed. But one friend was gone, and she spent days honoring her memories. Yet, as she packed for a new life, she felt like a drifter stuck in the same loop. A ghost haunting the same room, lost in time, never differentiating dawn from dusk.
	“Yeah. Life.” The friend said.
	“Life.” She agreed. 
	“Always the same shit, don’t you think?” The friend responded. “Life.”
	“Really?” She asked. “I don’t know. My life changed a lot. I’m growing. I am.”
	The familiar sludge swarmed in her stomach.
	The friend hummed. They sat there in silence until the sun set. The clouds melted into the sky, and the golden hues and soft pinks embellished the view. It looked beautiful. A gift from God, indeed. It worked well together. Clouds were meant to be in the sky. 
	“If clouds looked any different, would the sky be ugly?” She asked her friend. “Is the sky pretty primarily because clouds look the way they do?”

  <section class = "paragraph">
    <p>The friend blinked. “Honestly--the sky looks pretty even without clouds.”
	Her friend left shortly thereafter. It was a good talk, a session that lifted the weight off her shoulders time and time again. Her friend of half a decade. The friend she first took shots with, the friend she giddily discussed sex with, the friend she partied with, traveled with, gossiped with-- Oh, she will miss them. Oh, she spent too much time with bad people. She didn’t spend enough time with the right people. Why didn’t she spend more time with them? They were too easy. Too good. They felt too good to be true. Maybe they were too good for her. Maybe he was right about you.
She stretched out the remnants of grief as she pondered over the wrong decisions, tears slowly dripping down her face. She sat at the desk in her room, propping her legs up on her bed, and she stared aimlessly. She thought of him. And him. And her, and a little bit of grief clung on, because she also thought of Him. She prayed to Him, as she prayed to other things. Prayed to skies with clouds and prayed for hair transformations turning out well. She prayed about happiness. She prayed about love. She prayed about healing. She wondered how it would happen. She prayed He wouldn't forget about her. 
Suddenly, on the corner of her desk, she noticed that dawdy green lipstick lost amongst papers and pencils. Maybe it’d work this time--different hair and she goes to the gym now. But her skin is the same. Her skin can never change. She should just throw it out. How did it suddenly appear again? For five years, it will show up right after it was forgotten. She should just throw it out. 
	Instead, she wipes it off, tosses it aside, and goes to bed.
