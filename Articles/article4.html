    <h2> STORY by Caden S.  PHOTO by Hitha G, Keon O, Shreya R</h2>

      <p>
         I did in three days what it takes the body seven to ten years to do - kill and replace every cell in my body.
It started with heartbreak, as so many stories do. My heart shattered so completely that I had to get a new one. It felt good to have a heart unburdened with grief, the way that the rest of my body was. But it made it harder to cope with everything else. 
I felt like I couldn’t breathe without Them there, so I tore out my lungs and replaced them as well. All of my blood drained out of my face, then arms, then all the way out of my body. I had to refill every vein and artery with new blood. 
After that, I started to feel better. I went home. To Our home. 
Their memory was everywhere. Every sound, smell, taste, feel, and sight was of Their ghost. So, I ripped it all away. I pulled out my eyes and tongue, shaved off my ears, nose, and lips, and broke off my hands. I replaced them all with new ones, ones that had never met Them, never held Their hands or tasted Their food, never seen Their smile or heard Their laugh.
But it wasn’t enough.
I still felt them everywhere.
I tore it all away. 
I untangled my intestines and pulled them out, piece by piece. I peeled away every inch of skin from my bones, every bone away from my tendons, and every tendon away from my muscles. Every cell of my body that had any memory of Them was cut out so blank new cells could fill in the gaps. 
And still, Their memory persisted in the most painful ways.
There was only one original organ remaining. 
I took a scalpel and cut the new skin and bone around my head, and with the precision of a true surgeon, removed my scalp. Without damaging one, I sliced each neuron from my brain and lifted it out of my skull. I got a new one, free of any memory of Them.

Philosophy asks if I am the same person after what I did. I ask if I’m a better person for it. 
At the time, I did what I did because I thought that I would die if I stayed how I was. But I think that when I changed, I sort of died anyway. Nothing about me is the same -  not my personality, my laugh, my sense of humor, nothing except my name. A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet, but to call a flower and a sharp rock “Rose” does not make those items the same.  
We don’t stay the same over time - We’re like rivers, we change by the second without changing at all. But unlike the river, I cannot recognize my own face from 3 days ago, and I can’t recognize my body now. 

Now people don’t recognize me when they look at my baby pictures. I don’t recognize myself when my family tells stories about when I was young. I swear that I’m the same person, but there are times when I jump because I don’t recognize the face in the mirror. 

I still miss them every day, but the pain is a distant, dull throb instead of the crushing weight. There is an empty feeling somewhere inside where my memories and love for Them used to be. I think. But then again, this body has never known any memories or love of Them.
