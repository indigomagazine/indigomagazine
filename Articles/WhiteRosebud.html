  The sunâ€™s rays peered through the stained glass, casting its curious glance upon the woman
that lies in her final trance. With her throat parched, she reaches towards the scowling silver bell
on her bedside table. Filling her lungs with all her might, her frail hands clench upon the handle.
The frigid metal presses into her wrist with her every swing. The chime echoes through the open
door and into the empty hallways. Disgruntled, the bell falls from her grasp, a final chime ringing
against the hall.

She casts her gaze towards the bare wall, its blush-ridden wallpaper peeling away at the edges.
They're watching again - the shadows. Fear has become unbeknownst to the woman. In turn,
the shadows become her companions. Their soft figures seem to glide as they move to a tune
only they can hear. They're not always the same. They change their shape like that of a cloud.
Their malleable forms tell a story, one that the woman knows quite well.

Childish laughter fills the room as the shadows take their form. The walls break apart, making
way for a girl with a powder blue capelet around her shoulders. Dark paint is smeared across
her arms as the Governess calls out her name from the kitchen window. The midday sun shines
bright as the girl runs through the grass and into the forest line. The Governess' voice fades into
the distance, and in turn, the girl comes upon a secluded pavilion overlooking the lake. The
water was a peculiar sort of green. Its emerald shade seemed to glow at all times of the day.
Even at night, some would say. On the floor of the pavilion was a small flower-printed cloth.
Upon it were two stolen tea cups and crumbs of sponge cake leading up to the thief herself -
Little Penny. Penny was the girl's neighbor and her closest friend. They spent all their time
together with tea parties and make-believe stories about falling in love and seeing the world until
the sun set and their Governesses called them back home.

The woman watches her young self in her childhood daze. Time seemed to stand still as her
memories breezed by. What beauty it is to watch yourself and the steps you made in the final
moments of life. What beauty it is to remember the moments that were once forgotten. What
beauty it is to feel what you felt like before, where excitement gives a warm feeling from the
depths of your soul, where sorrow pushes you to bear the nightmares in the darkest corners of
your mind, and where love makes you believe in a life after death.

She first met him in the rain.
<br><br>
He stumbled upon her reading in the pavilion, and being new to town, he was lost.
<br><br>
"Good afternoon, Miss," he called out.
<br><br>
She barely moved a muscle, enthralled in the world of the Eloi and the Morlocks. The rain
poured heavily, drenching his clothes as his shoes sank into the muddy ground.
<br><br>
"Miss!" he calls out once more.
<br><br>
Yet again, it is ignored. Feeling exasperated, he finds a small rock and throws it near her book.
Startled, she jumps up with her book held to her chest. She looks up to see a rather odd man.
He was utterly drenched in the rain, his satchel falling apart from its seams upon his shoulder as
he held on to his top hat. He looked young, just a year or two older than her.

  "A lady should never be alone with a gentleman without her chaperone," her mother's words
echoed in her ear.
<br><br>
"Quite the intriguing book you have there, I must say."
<br><br>
She looks down at her book and immediately hides it behind her back.
<br><br>
"Pardon me for the intrusion, but can you please point me towards the Granton Estate?" he
asks.
<br><br>
She stays silent as her mother's words of decorum are incessant in her mind.

"Ah, my apologies. I appear not to have introduced myself. I am Alexander Granton. I'm a
doctor, well studying to be one. I am a newcomer to these parts and am looking for my uncle's
estate. I apologize for the scare," he said.
<br><br>
Her shock seemed to wear off, and she quickly pointed to her right.
<br><br>
"You would want to proceed down this trail and take the first left. Just walk for a few blocks until
you reach the junction and take a right turn. From there, it's a short walk to the estate," she said.
<br><br>
He dipped his head in gratitude and left with, "Until we meet again."

They did indeed meet again. With accidental encounters in the library and the park, they grew
close to each other. Under the guise of friendship, they grew to be something more. With her
mother's adamant insistence on marriage, she and Dr. Granton would each save a dance at the
end of parties. He'd ask her about the book she was reading, and she'd ask him about his
current fixation on what he was studying. They fascinated each other and would meet at the
pavilion each time it rained.
<br><br>
"I love him," she wrote in her journal the night before he left for his medical trip hours away.
Every week, they'd send each other letters. It'd contain the town gossip and their daily routine
between their declarations of love. They'd always end it with Tomorrow - a promise.

Six months had passed, and he was home. The next day, they were engaged. On the day of
their wedding, she stared into the eyes of her reflection. Penny comes up to her side and locks
their arms.
<br><br>
"Well, it seems dreams do indeed come true," says Penny.
<br><br>
Soon, the years pass by, and their family grows. Even in the midst of frustration and anger,
they've never held each other any closer than the day they fell in love. Their hair turns gray with
every new day. The summers felt warmer while the winters felt colder, yet the rain stayed the
same.

He was the first to go. She held his delicate hands as he lay in bed. His smile was ever present
despite the pain. They spent his last hours gazing at their past. The season's first rain began as
he breathed his last wordâ€”"Tomorrow."
<br><br>
With just the utterance of the word, the blush-ridden walls fall back into place. The woman is
back in her bed with the sun long gone and, in its place, the night sky. Sorrow wraps her throat
as the air around her becomes harder to breathe. With each harsh breath, a shadow draws
close, its top hat tilted to the side. The dark figure looms across the bed, and she can only stare
at the faceless apparition. Familiarity seeps into her soul as the world gets darker. A wry smile
falls upon her face. How can something be so familiar when it never really existed?
<br><br>
The shadow and the others stepped away as the thought rang through her mind. They are now
stained on the wall in the blood of a young woman's dreamscape. A single tear falls onto her
cheek as she mourns the life she'd never have. A life cut so short, they'll say, at the young age
of nineteen.
