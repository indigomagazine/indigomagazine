      I feel the freest I’ve felt in a long time.

      I had to undo all the restrictions that had been placed on me. I had to unlearn the rules I had been taught. I had
      to release all expectations of myself. I had to free myself, for the sake of my sanity.

      How long could I have gone on, the way that they made me? How long could I have valued their priorities over my
      own health? How long could I have been striving for an image I could never reach? I don’t want to break down just
      ten years from now. I want to continue living.

      I want to continue living in my creativity. I want to continue expressing myself.

      The industrialization of my thoughts has almost killed me.

      They program the machine to produce, produce, produce. You’re profiting from this all, of course, is what they
      tell me. If I offer up my creativity now, my line of revenue will sustain me long down the line. Give up your
      freedom to have the money to live free later. The machine gets slower as time goes on. It doesn’t have the
      capacity to let them know it’s burning out. It’s only nuts and bolts, after all.

      They throw up ads of pristine men and women, and they sell us what is right. We have no choice but to believe
      them; they are the guidelines for our society. I want to do what is right in what I make. I will buy your idea,
      and I will internalize, and I will incorporate it into everything that I do. I can’t dare to dream. I can’t stray
      from the person to my right or to my left. I’ve grown tired of uniformity, but all I see are the ads and what they
      know to be right.

      I must continue to upgrade all of my own technology. All the time, they show me how this person has created a new
      vacuum that’s twice as fast. This person invented a new shoe rack that the mud from your floors. This person is
      making this steam-powered and now you’ll never have to lift a finger. I compare my outdated items to theirs and it
      makes me want to die. How could I ever be important if I’m not consistently trying to upgrade?

      I have worked in my one factory position my whole entire life. I think an air of wonder was here when I first
      started, but the atmosphere is now thick with disappointment. I know plenty who are still happy here, by the way
      that they hum as they work on the assembly line. I’m messing up simple tasks that I could do in my sleep when I
      got here. The hat-making factory across the street has rejected my application. They said I’d chosen a job, and I
      should stick with it. I think about whether I’d rather make no money at all.

      The fog has lifted from my eyes, and I’ve escaped their optimized society. To place these restrictions and
      expectations on the freedom of creative practice is to force into this lifeless system. I can be a part of it no
      longer.

      All I’ve ever wanted is to be creative. All I’ve ever wanted is to express myself. And for the first time in a
      long time, I’m free to do it in my own element.
