    <p style="text-align: left;"><em>“Is your motivation the reward of getting something, or the fear of not attaining it? I think it’s up to people to make that choice for themselves.”<br>
Neuroscience graduate Carlos Salinas shares his opinion on fear, and how it impacts peoples’ lives.

        R: Many argue that humans live their lives out of fear. Do you agree, and why or why not?
<br><br>
C: I don’t agree. I feel like they can be run by fear if you let them. But how often in a day are you fearful, and can say that’s what motivated you to accomplish your goals?<br>
I struggle to find a situation in my life where I am driven by fear. It’s mostly just me trying to attain goal A, B or C.<br>
I understand the argument that says people attain their goals because if they don’t, they won’t be able to pay for rent or food. So at the base of it, there can be some fear driving you, but I also think that is only if you choose to look at things that way, if you choose to see that you’re oppressed by the necessities of your life.
<br><br>
R: So vice versa, for someone who is fearful in life: do you believe it is in their nature, or they became that way?
<br><br>
C: I think it’s because of unfortunate circumstances they grew up in. I feel like if you lived in a situation where you had reason to fear something, you’d soon enough become trained to fear everything else in your life. <br>
I guess it has to do a bit with upbringing, and what values in your life you decide are going to motivate you. Is it going to be the reward of getting something, or the fear of not attaining it? I think it’s up to people to make that choice for themselves.

        R: Did you personally ever have a fear that made you change the way you live your life?
<br><br>
C: One time I was driving on the highway and my car wheel just disintegrated. It didn’t have enough air, and so the metal frame on the inside started to eat away at it, and my wheels just gave out. And really, it was me being silly and not taking care of things properly. But it was pretty scary being stranded on the highway and having cars zoom past me, especially when their speed would shake my car. <br>
But how that affects my life is that now I’m more prepared. I decided to check the air in my tires more often after that.<br>
That’s the only way I can say that fear has molded my life. As a consequence of not being prepared, I was in a frightful situation. But I now make the necessary changes so I don’t end up in such situations anymore. <br>
So in my life, fear has actually been an aid. It resulted in me paying more attention to things. 
No situation has ever been so devastating that fear paralyzed me; it has only helped me look at the places where I’m lacking.
<br><br>
R: What advice would you give to someone to get over a fear?
<br><br>
C: There’s an idea in psychology that you should slowly be exposed to the thing that you fear until you no longer fear it. For example, if you're scared of snakes: You can look at pictures of snakes, and then maybe a rubber snake, then stand 10 feet away from the rubber snake, and then 5 feet away from the rubber snake, and then actually touch the rubber snake. Gradually move up in this manner until you get to a point where you're capable of being in the same room as a snake or even holding one. In the act of experiencing what you fear, you come to find that your fear is smaller than you imagined, not as wicked as you thought, and capable of being overcome.
