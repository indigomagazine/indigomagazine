        Dreams blurred the divide between truth and reality. 
        <br><br>
        It was a strange place that drew shape from the impossible and drew breath from the imagination. Even stranger was how the dream felt at once familiar and unfamiliar—amazing and uncanny.
        <br><br>
        Though always of some notion like a blanket on one’s skin, entering its domain never elicited the same sensation twice. Dreams swirled in cosmic particles to swaddle entrants and deliver them onto planets of wild plains, or they transported them through a temperature-less fluid, dipping dreamers in different flavored layers of worlds. Or they guided dreamers to emerge from the void, to take another’s hand, and feel the radiance of a smile that had waited forever and would wait forever more.
        <br><br>
        This kind of recognition was not allowed to be noticed. Dreamers rarely did, for they were too caught up in the flurries spun by clouds of thought. And rightly so, but on occasion, the dreams would spread a little too thin while crafting the ancient castle overlooking the faerie moor. On occasion, they would detail too deeply the strength of this warm other hand and the sound of steps climbing a stone stairwell. 

      </p>

      <p>
        The warm hand gripped a little harder as the stairs flattened at the top. A light, the fairies’ dawn, puffed soft pinks across the sky, visible from the tower’s opening. In two steps, we could perch on the balcony to watch the night stars dance into sleep and the day stars arouse for their turn in the sky. But the warm hand tugged me in the opposite direction of the balcony. When I turned to look back, the smile was gone—for a second. It returned, just as warm, but not as radiant.
        <br><br>
        “Sorry. I was thinking about something. Let’s go.”
        <br><br>
        They stepped forward, but I didn’t move. The voice was familiar, a spot where a known unknown pricked me sore. That warm hand that now trembled in mine—I <em>knew</em>. 
        <br><br>
        Always, whether dressed in cosmic cloth or dipped into different worlds, this hand, this smile had always been with me—this smile that always shined when seeing me and dimmed when leaving.
        <br><br>
        I gripped that hand harder.
        <br><br>
        Don’t leave.
        <br><br>
        The pink sky grew brighter, the faeries’ dawn peaking to its height, but its dramatics meant little compared to the hope that lit in those wide eyes. I watched the color in them reflect the luminescence of outside and found a wonder right where I stood. They stepped back to me, clutching both my hands to their sternum. 
        <br><br>
        “Y-You recognize me?”
        <br><br>
        Words held shapelessness on my tongue, so I could only nod, fervently, frantically.
        <br><br>
        “How? You’re not supposed to. I thought you’d never— I thought I’d be doomed to—”
        <br><br>
        They stopped themselves with a bite of their lips, then spoke pleasantly, their eyes like pretty glass but refracting the trapped pain in their gaze. 
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        
      “No, this isn’t good. Let’s go see the faerie dawn, okay?”
      <br><br>
      They ushered me forward, and I dug in my feet, yanked them back, desperate for meaning to manifest out of my actions where words failed. I couldn’t remember everything, only wisps of recollections that were locked away in cages I never wanted. 
      <br><br>
      But now I remembered. I remembered and wanted to keep remembering this warmth, this kindness, this hope. The distinction was blurring in my vision, in that strange dip of temperature-less fluid again, and I wrapped them in a hug, with my gaze. <em>Please, please, please—</em>
      <br><br>
      Arms clasped around me, and for one stitching of time I could melt into this embrace and love the tenderness between us, to grasp as much as possible before it, too, became a wisp. The body holding me, real in this indistinct realm, held tighter as the pink dawn started to shine a little too brightly.
      <br><br>
      “I’ll come to you again, okay? I’ll come to you, and if you can remember me— If you remember me, I’ll explain everything to you. We… We can meet again if that’s what you wish for.” 
      <br><br>
      Their words tumbled out but strained. I heard how they wanted to say more, to speak their wishes too, but they bit their lips again. I wanted to hear them, hear those wishes, and make them true.
      <br><br>
      Their touch was fading to the edges of my senses, and what felt like my body’s consciousness started swaying, fuzzy and blending like the colors of the stone and faerie dawn. A haze laid heavy on my mind, lulling and tempting, and the circumstances of this dream started to evaporate from my memory. But I found those eyes, warm, wanting to hold on, willing to wait for forever more, and smiled.
      <br><br>
      This moment had only been by chance, and I wouldn’t waste it.
